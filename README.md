# Computational Biology: Assignment 4

This code was developed for Assignment 4 of the Computational Biology course (May 2025). The program simulates fungal root growth under different conditions.

- **mycelium_model_species.py** contains the simulation for a single fungal root system under a single nutrient condition.
- **mycelium_model_species_competition_single_nutrient.py** implements the simulation for competing fungal root systems under a single nutrient condition.
- **data_analysis.py** handles the post-simulation processing, including loading (from pickle files) and visualising the simulation results.
